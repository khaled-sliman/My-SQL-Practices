This is a housing data cleaning project which do some operations on data using SQL so that we can use it easy and efficiency.

Some operations that I will do :
 1 - Standardize Date Format (convert the format of "Saledate" from datetime to date).          
 2 - Populate Property Address data (replace null values in the 'PropertyAddress' column by the right address).           
 3 - Breaking out "PropertyAddress" into Individual Columns (Address, City, State).        
 4 - Breaking out "OwnerAddress" into Individual Columns (Address, City, State).         
 5 - Change Y and N to Yes and No in "Sold as Vacant" field.       
 6 - Remove Duplicate Rows.            
 7 - Delete Unused Columns.            
 
 Note : the source of data is in 'Nashville Housing Data.xlsx' file.
